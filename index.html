            I am a sleepy young Software Engineer from Irapuato Guanajuato, currently I am about to finish my
            career at Itesi, this is my "Last semester" as a student and I am taking MagmaHackers iniciative as a way to develop
            my skills as as programer and also want to get better at remotely working
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              About my programming skills I am proefficent in Python language, and also have basic skills in fields like Java, C#, Javascript and SQL.

            <h2 class="header center teal-text teal-lighten-2">What do I like?</h2>
            <p class="left-align">There are a lot of things that I like to do, like playing with my pets (currently 3 dogs and 3 cats), taking walks, fliying
            my drone, talk with friends and listen to music. But what I like the most, in no particular order is playing videogames,
            watching anime and watching movies.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">My favorite genre of movies is terror, and even though most of them are bad the subgenre I like is the possession one.
              My favorite movie is Devil Possession the 2013 remake.</p>
              <p class="left-align">I play a lot of videogames in my spare time, currently my focus is an MMO called Maplestory
              besides that I have 3 genres which I love the most, they are: plataformer, stealth and bullet hell. If I had to choose my favorite tittle
              it would be Megaman Zero.</p>
              <p class="left-align">And last but not least, I have to say that I am not the classic otaku who energetically looking
              forward to watch the next season of the anime industry, in fact I do not tend to follow current trends in anime so I prefer to
              watch severeal years old anime, or at last anime with 2 years old from now. When it comes to anime I like stories who appears to be deep
              with long chats that may appear boring and uninteresting, but I believe that knowing where you look at you will be able to find hidden gems.
              And thats how I found Kara no Kyoukai as my favorite series being a strange mix between horror and psychologycal topics.</p>
